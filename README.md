An experimental simulation, made so that I can play around with various technologies (for example, OpenGL).

As of this writing, the project is fairly bare-bones, but I might add more features to it later.

Features:
- Procedural terrain generation (2D)
- Simple map rendering with OpenGL
- Basic avatar, with movement and terrain collision

This was originally my final project for CSE 210 Programming With Classes, but I took it a little further than was required.
